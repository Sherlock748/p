# Picture

Use the ggame library to "paint" a graphical picture of something (e.g. a house, a face or landscape).

Use at least:

1. Three different Color objects.
2. Ten different Sprite objects.
3. One (or more) RectangleAsset objects.
4. One (or more) CircleAsset objects.
5. One (or more) EllipseAsset objects.
6. One (or more) PolygonAsset objects.

Similar to the first two challenges: fork this repository to your own account, then edit ```picture.py```.
